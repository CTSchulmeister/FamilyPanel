# FamilyPanel - Front End

This is the front end for the FamilyPanel application.

## Getting Started

First, install the required packages.

```
npm install
```

Then, make sure to provide proper environment variables.  A .env.example file is included as a template.

Now you can start the application!

```
npm start
```

The FamilyPanel front end depends on the back end for functionality.  Have both started in order for the application to work.
