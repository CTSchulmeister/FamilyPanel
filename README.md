# FamilyPanel

FamilyPanel is a MERN stack application for helping household members coordinate with each other.

This project is divided into two main directories:
- Server: Backend code for the database and API
- Client: Frontend code for the React-driven UI

## Getting Started

The front end and back end of this application run, as one would expect, in tandem.  To see how to start each of these, refer to their specific README file.
